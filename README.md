## Debs Dezotti
**Data Scientist**

Hi there 👋
I’m Debora, but you can call me Debs, a data scientist who works end-to-end: from building models and uncovering insights to improving the systems, processes and communication around them.
I like making data work better for teams and stakeholders: with faster pipelines, clearer structures, and (beautiful 😎) outputs that actually support decisions.

I’m skilled in modeling, pipeline optimization, workflow automation and clean communication. I’ve streamlined modeling processes, automated manual tasks, significantly reduced runtime, and designed reusable structures that simplify handoffs and collaboration.

A big part of my work involves bridging the gap between technical depth and business clarity. My design background helps me turn complex results into intentional, purpose-driven materials, dashboards, visuals and executive presentations that make insights easier to understand, communicate and act on.

I enjoy shaping processes that bring both technical rigor and clarity to stakeholders, helping teams deliver with more confidence and alignment. And I thrive in collaborative environments, where work is built together and good communication amplifies impact.

Let's bring data to life together!
